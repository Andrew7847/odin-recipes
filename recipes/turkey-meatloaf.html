        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p><i>A slightly lighter version of the all-American classic, this satisfying meatloaf uses chicken broth and soaked panko to stay moist, and a mix of fresh herbs for flavor. It’s the best turkey meatloaf you’ll find!</i></p>

            <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh sage</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, grated</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>3 pounds ground turkey</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><strong>Method:</strong></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, thyme, sage, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are softened, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more. Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, stirring to incorporate. Stir in the Worcestershire. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.</li>
                <li>Add the panko to a large mixing bowl and pour over the chicken broth so the breadcrumbs soak up the liquid. Add the turkey, eggs, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and the cooled onion mixture and mix well with your hands until well combined. Form the mixture into a 10-by-5-inch loaf on the foil-lined baking sheet. Coat the top and sides with the ketchup.</li>
                <li>Put the meatloaf in the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until a thermometer inserted in the center of the loaf reads 165 degrees F, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool slightly before slicing and serving.</li>
            </ol>
